# School-Bus-Route-Optimization

This repository contains a project report on a school bus routing optimization problem formulated as a mixed-integer linear program with capacity and time-window constraints.

The project was conducted as part of an academic operations management course and focuses on:
- vehicle routing problem formulation,
- optimization modeling,
- evaluation of operational performance improvements.

Due to the sensitivity of the data and project-specific assumptions, only the report is shared; a standalone reproducible version is not provided.
